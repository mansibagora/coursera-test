  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-5 col-sm-12"><div id="box">INTEGER</div><p>An integer (from the Latin integer meaning "whole")[note 1] is a number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are integers, while 9.75, 5+

, and √2 are not.

The set of integers consists of zero (0), the positive natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...), also called whole numbers or counting numbers,[2][3] and their additive inverses (the negative integers, i.e., −1, −2, −3, ...). The set of integers is often denoted by a boldface Z ("Z") or blackboard bold {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }\mathbb {Z}  (Unicode U+2124 ℤ) standing for the German word Zahlen ([ˈtsaːlən], "numbers").</p></section>
  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-5 col-sm-12"><div id="box">REAL NUMBER</div><p>Real numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers are equally spaced. Any real number can be determined by a possibly infinite decimal representation, such as that of 8.632, where each consecutive digit is measured in units one tenth the size of the previous one. The real line can be thought of as a part of the complex plane, and complex numbers include real numbers.</p></section>
  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><div id="box">RATIONAL NUMBER</div><p>In mathematics, a rational number is a number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q.[1] Since q may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number. The set of all rational numbers, often referred to as "the rationals".The decimal expansion of a rational number always either terminates after a finite number of digits or begins to repeat the same finite sequence of digits over and over. Moreover, any repeating or terminating decimal represents a rational number</p></section>
